# Inline Diff Viewer with Comments

This feature adds an inline code diff viewer that displays changed files and PR modifications directly within Neovim. Users can leave review comments and notes without opening a browser, with support for threaded discussions and jump-to-latest-unread functionality. A local draft mode allows composing comprehensive reviews offline before submitting them to GitHub.
