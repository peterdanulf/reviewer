# Smart Filtering & Label Management

This feature provides a visual label management UI within the picker for filtering pull requests by GitHub labels. Users can save and load custom filter presets like "My PRs", "Urgent Review", or "Team Backlog" for quick access to common views. The system supports tagging PRs with local custom labels for enhanced workflow organization beyond GitHub's built-in labels.
